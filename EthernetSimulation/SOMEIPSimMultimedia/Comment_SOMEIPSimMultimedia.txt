-------------------------- SOME/IP MM Demo --------------------------------------

This sample works in simulation mode. A Head Unit, CD Changer and GPS Unit are 
simulated.

Alternatively this configuration can be used in real operation
with a Ethernet interface.

In this sample configuration the following functions are shown in the
context of SOME/IP:

* Simulation with CANoe:

   * Simulation of Ethernet ECUs in the simulation setup. Each ECU is 
      represented by a node in the simulation setup.
   * Simulation of a control console Head Unit for operating the blocks 
      CD Changer and the GPS Unit.
      The node 'HeadUnit' primarily serves the operation of the configuration. 
      In particular, this CAPL node shows:
      * Receipt of SOME/IP messages sent over Ethernet
      * Display of data in the Head Unit panel
      * Use of the XML system interface description for the symbolic access 
        to signals and messages in CAPL.
      * Integration of panels with various control and display elements
   * Simulation of the CD Changer:
     * This CAPL node shows the simple programming templates, with which a 
        function block can be simulated. In particular, it shows:
        * The use of the SOME/IP API for responding to and sending messages.

* Testing with CANoe:

  The demo introduces testing with CANoe as a significant feature.
  
    * The use of a test setup (desktop Setup) to place test modules 
       separate from the simulation. 
       These test nodes can be added to each configuration later.
    * XML test module: The comments in the XML files describe which tests are
       executed here. Test results and information about individual test steps can
       be viewed in the test report.
    * CAPL test module: The CAPL test module TestLib demonstrates an easy
       way to formulate test sequences in CAPL. After executing the test module, 
       the test report receives detailed information about which test 
       steps were executed with what results.
    * Execution window (desktop simulation): The execution window is available to 
       control a test module. In this window, you can select the test steps, start 
       the test and open the test report.

* Data analysis with CANoe:
 
  A number of functions are introduced that support the analysis of Ethernet data.

  * With the help of the desktops, windows can be arranged in a specific structure.
  * In the measurement setup (see desktop Setup), you can add filter blocks to 
     filter events from the bus. 
  * Configure the settings of the trace window.
     * Coloring user defined individual messages or message groups
     * Columns displayed
  * Display of statistical data in the statistics window.
  * Usage of CAPL with the Ethernet & SOME/IP Interaction Layer DLLs to transfer data 
    over Ethernet.
